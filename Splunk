step1(Port Enable): To allow the logs from slave to master we need to allow the ports in master, /opt/splunk/bin/ ./splunk enable listen 9997
 
step2(Destination): The logs are in the slave, we should do the logs to go to master, so go to slave machine /opt/splunkforwarder/bin
./splunk add forward-server 55.167.67.8:9997
